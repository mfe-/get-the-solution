<h1 id="android-debug-bridge">Android Debug Bridge</h1>
<p>Working with the command-line tool <code>adb</code> can come in very handy, when you are trying to analyze an installed android app on your device. To get started you need install the Android SDK which ships the tool <code>adb</code> (along with some other helpful applications). I find it quite pleasant to add the directory, which is containing the executable <code>adb</code>, to the <code>$PATH</code> enviroment. So <code>adb</code> will always be available in the command-line (without switching into the android skd binary folder). More Fundamentals about adb see <a href="https://android.jlelse.eu/android-debug-bridge-fundamentals-2071363824cd">here</a></p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>The next step is to &quot;activate&quot; the adb endpoint on your (mobile) device. This can be achieved by enabling <code>USB debugging</code> under <code>Developer options</code>. Maybe as a side note, this works probably on most consumer mobile devices. If you own a work phone, its possible that the company applied restrictive policy rules and enabling 'USB debugging' is not enough to get the adb server working.</p>
<p>If you are activating <code>USB debugging</code> and connecting the device to your computer for the first time you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/blog/20210117-1-Tap-7-times-on-buildnumer-to-enable-developer.png" alt="Abb. 1. enable developer" width="240" /> <img src="assets/img/blog/20210117-2-Allow-USB-Debugging.png" alt="Abb. 1. allow usb debugging" width="240" /> <img src="assets/img/blog/20210117-092142-3-Allow-USB-Debugging-fingerprint.png" alt="Abb. 1. allow usb debugging fingerprint" width="240" /></p>
<p>In this case the device should be listed with the command <code>adb devices</code>. If your device isn't listed by the command <code>adb devices</code>, you need to make sure that the connection from the computer to the device is working. You can try exchanging the USB-Cable or disable/enabling USB debugging, revoking all USB debugging authorizations etc.</p>

<p>Android is running some kind of linux derivation, and <code>adb</code> makes it accessible by the command <code>adb shell</code>. This way we are able to execute some known Linux commands like <code>ls</code>, <code>ps</code> and so on. You can do that by <code>adb shell YOURCOMMAND</code> or <code>adb shell</code> which opens the bash. Lets do so.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">adb</span> shell

<p>You see the typical Filesystem Hierarchy Standard of linux. But lets move on and display all installed app packages on the device. We can use the command <code>pm</code> (or <code>adb shell cmd package list packages</code> but then you have to exit bash) with the parameter <code>-f</code> (to display the installed path) and use <code>grep</code> to filter for a specific app name. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">HWSLA-Q</span>:/ $ pm list packages -f <span class="kw">|</span> <span class="fu">grep</span> microsoft
<span class="ex">package</span>:/data/app/com.microsoft.appmanager-1/base.apk=com.microsoft.appmanager
<span class="ex">package</span>:/data/app/com.microsoft.office.officelens-2/base.apk=com.microsoft.office.officelens
<span class="ex">package</span>:/data/app/com.microsoft.skydrive-1/base.apk=com.microsoft.skydrive
<span class="ex">package</span>:/data/app/com.microsoft.office.onenote-2/base.apk=com.microsoft.office.onenote
<span class="ex">package</span>:/data/app/com.microsoft.emmx-2/base.apk=com.microsoft.emmx

<span class="ex">package</span>:com.kitkats.qrscanner</code></pre></div>
<p>To display device related settings like the Android OS version you can use the following command:</p>

<h2 id="investigate-bugs-in-your-app">Investigate bugs in your app</h2>
<p>Sometimes it’s hard to reproduce bugs from a production environment. In this case it’s helpfull to know the app state at least when the issue occurred. For example, how did the sql lite database look like in your app or which settings were used. In this case we can try to obtain the whole app data by creating a backup of the app.</p>
<p>To create a backup of an android app you can use <code>adb backup</code>. Make sure you exited the linux device bash with <code>exit</code>. In the sample I created a backup of the app package <code>at.oebb.ts</code> and stored the backup into the file <code>oebb.backu</code> (If you’re wondering <code>backu</code> is just a typo I was too lazy to fix). When calling the command you need to unlock your device and press &quot;Backup my Data&quot; (the password field can be empty).</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">C</span>:\Users<span class="op">&gt;</span>adb backup -apk -shared packages at.oebb.ts -f oebb.backu
<span class="ex">Now</span> unlock your device and confirm the backup operation...  </code></pre></div>
<p>Lets extract the backup so we are able to see the content of it. For this I use <code>( printf &quot;\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00&quot; ; tail -c +25 oebb.backu ) |  tar xfvz -</code></p>
<p>From the extracted files you can determine that the app &quot;öbb&quot; is using a sqlite database (Application.db for storing data) and for logging and app usage analysis they use the service of Microsoft named Appcenter.ms (AppCenter.xml).</p>
<p>There is also another way to retrieve the data from the device to your computer. Lets use <code>adb pull</code> for it. First we copy our files to the <code>/sdcard/</code> (adb pull has not always access to the directory <code>/sdcard</code>) by using <code>adb shell &quot;cp /data/app/at.oebb.ts-2/base.apk /sdcard/base.apk&quot;</code>. Now we can pull it from our device as shown below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">adb</span> pull /sdcard/base.apk base.apk.oebb
<span class="ex">/sdcard</span>/base.apk: <span class="ex">1</span> file pulled. 21.8 MB/s (23672488 bytes in 1.034s)</code></pre></div>
<p>Having the base.apk allows us to view the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> with <code>aapt2 d xmltree --file An-droidManifest.xml base.apk.oebb</code> (The program <code>aapt2</code> is also shipped with the Android SDK.). This shows the version, the permission and some other details the app is using.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">C</span>:\Users<span class="op">&gt;</span>aapt2 d xmltree --file AndroidManifest.xml base.apk.oebb

<p>If your not investigating a business related bug but an app crash you may be interested in the command <code>adb bugreport</code>.</p>
<h2 id="run-as">run-as</h2>
<p>To run shell commands in the context of your app you can use the command <code>run-as</code>. An example command would be <code>adb shell run-as app.package yourcommand</code>, this only works if a debugable version of the app is installed (which is mainly the case if you are the developer of the app). You may ask, why would I like to fire shell commands from within my app?</p>
<p>Imagine you received a sqlite database from a productive device and you want to reproduce an issue which was reported with it. Because normally you don’t have enough privileges to override the sqlite database within your app data folder, you can do this when using <code>run-as</code></p>
<p>To push the file (e.g. the sqlite) from your computer to the (mobile) device use <code>adb push local filesystem /sdcard/filename</code>. After the file is pushed to the sdcard of the device make use of <code>adb shell</code> in combination with <code>cp</code> or <code>mv</code> to move it further to the app location. If there is already a file existing on the device with the same name in your target location, I would recommend to rename it as <code>cp -f</code> didn't work out for me.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<pre class="batch"><code>rem first remove the file (better rename it)
adb -d shell &quot;run-as at.oebb.ts rm /data/data/at.oebb/db/Application.db&quot;
rem copy db to the sdcard
adb push Application.db /sdcard/Application.db
rem copy from sdcard to app folder
adb -d shell &quot;run-as at.oebb.ts cp /sdcard/Application.db /data/data/at.oebb/db/Application.db -rf&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note: If you don’t have the debugable app of <code>at.oebb.ts</code>, <code>run-as</code> will not work.</p>
<h2 id="logcat">logcat</h2>
<p>Another great command is <code>logcat</code> which can be used to retrieve logs. Depending on which context you are calling <code>logcat</code> you receive system wide logs or you only receive logs of your app.</p>
<p>From an app perspective we can try to use logcat to detect a possible app crash (Disclaimer: You won’t see if the OS killed your app). This could be implemented like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>on app start execute a process with <code>logcat -vtime -d *:W</code> with <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/ProcessBuilder">ProcessBuilder</a></li>
<li>this will fetch the latest Warning, Errors and Crashes</li>
<li>forward the received logcat result to the app logger service (if no logcat result was fetched, there was no problem)</li>
<li>clear logcat with <code>logcat -c</code></li>
</ol>
<p>With the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/ProcessBuilder">ProcessBuilder</a> we can execute any command as we did with adb shell as long we have sufficient privileges. For example, you need permission to the <code>Picture</code> folder if you want to &quot;read&quot; the content of <code>Pictures</code> with <code>ls</code> and <code>ProcessBuilder</code>. Some commands or directories cannot be accessed as a &quot;normal&quot; developer and are restricted for firmware manufacturer. A sample implementation on how to read logcat from within an app can be seen <a href="https://github.com/mfe-/AdbApp/blob/df4704aee00512296f712891d1b36ae115c3199a/AdbApp.Android/AdbService.cs">here</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=get.the.solution.AdbApp">here</a>.</p>
