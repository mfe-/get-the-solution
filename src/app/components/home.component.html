    <h2><a routerLink="/home"> Hi there! My name is Martin ðŸ‘‹ </a></h2>
    <h3>ðŸ“… Back in 2008...</h3>
    <p>...my brother and I built a PHP CMS system, which was released under the name "get-the-solution". Over time, things changed and our focus shifted.</p>
    <h3>ðŸš€ Today...</h3>
    <p>...the website <a href="http://get-the-solution.net">get-the-solution.net</a> remains and its main topic is software engineering. With this website, I document solutions and events related to problems I encounter during my daily work by publishing articles or blog entries.</p>
    <p>An overview of articles and blog entries can be found <a routerLink="/category.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>More about <a routerLink="/contact.html">me</a>.</p>
