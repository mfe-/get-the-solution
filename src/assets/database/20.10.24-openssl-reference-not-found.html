<p>When I was compiling an application from source I ran into an error when using <code>./configure --prefix=/opt/</code></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">[<span class="ex">...</span>]

<span class="ex">configure</span>: error: not available</code></pre></div>
<p>From the error message it was clear that <code>configure</code> was unable to detect my openssl libary. I knew I had installed the openssl libary, but to be sure I checked by calling the openssl binary.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">/usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl</span>

<span class="ex">OpenSSL</span><span class="op">&gt;</span> q</code></pre></div>
<p>I needed to set the LDFLAGS enviroment variable to give gcc and the linker a hint where to look for the shared libraries. In this scenario the /usr/local/ssl/ path is important. You can find more about this <a href="https://flameeyes.blog/2010/06/20/the-why-and-how-of-rpath/">here</a></p>
<p>Actual openssl and other shared libaries will display this information when you compile and install the software by yourself. They will print something like that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">If</span> you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries 
<span class="kw">in</span> <span class="ex">a</span> given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and 
<span class="ex">specify</span> the full pathname of the library, or use the <span class="st">&#39;-LLIBDIR&#39;</span> 
<span class="ex">flag</span> during linking and do at least one of the following: 
   <span class="ex">-</span> add LIBDIR to the <span class="st">&#39;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&#39;</span> environment variable 
     <span class="ex">during</span> execution 
   <span class="ex">-</span> add LIBDIR to the <span class="st">&#39;LD_RUN_PATH&#39;</span> environment variable 
     <span class="ex">during</span> linking 
   <span class="ex">-</span> use the <span class="st">&#39;-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR&#39;</span> linker flag </code></pre></div>
<p>In addition, I set the LIBS flag too, which apperantly was wrong. Instead of</p>
<p><code>LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/usr/local/ssl/ -L/usr/local/ -L/usr/local/bin/ -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/ssl/,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/,--export-dynamic&quot; LIBS=&quot;-ldl&quot; CC=/opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/gcc CXX=/opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/g++  ./configure --prefix=/opt/</code> I later learnd, that I should have used <code>LDFLAGS=&quot;-L/usr/local/ssl/ -L/usr/local/ -L/usr/local/bin/ -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/ssl/,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/,--export-dynamic&quot; LIBS=&quot;-ldl -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto&quot; CC=/opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/gcc CXX=/opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/g++  ./configure --prefix=/opt/</code> instead.</p>
<p>Calling the <code>configure</code> script with the modified parameter worked well, as the script was now able to detect that openssl is installed. The next step was to compile the whole thing with <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>So the first sourcefiles could be compiled without any problems, but after a few minutes it stopped with the compiler error:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="ex">libtool</span>: link: /opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/gcc -fvisibility=hidden -g -O2 -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/ssl/ -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/local/lib/ -Wl,--export-dynamic -o .libs/httrack httrack.o  -L/usr/local/ssl/ -L/usr/local/ -L/usr/local/bin/ -L/usr/local/lib -lpthread ./.libs/libhttrack.so -lz -ldl -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/opt/lib

<p>I googled the compiler error message and as it turns out, it is related to ssl. So I suspected that the required ssl hints for the compiler didn't work out (The compiler error was caused by the incomplete LIBS flag, which I mentioned above). So the first thing I tried here, was to call the compiler command by hand. I changed the directory to the <code>src</code> folder and executed the printed command from <code>make</code> and I got the same error message. After googling I figured out that in addition I need the ssl flags as well.</p>
<p><code>/opt/gcc-4.6.0/bin/gcc -fvisibility=hidden -g -O2  -L/usr/local/ssl/ -L/usr/local/ -L/usr/local/bin/ -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/ssl/,-rpath,/usr/local/lib/,--export-dynamic -L/usr/local/lib -o httrack httrack.o -lpthread libhttrack.la -lz -ldl -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto</code></p>
<p>Tada! it compiled succesfully! I expected that <code>make</code> will skip my compiled file, since I already complied it by hand. But <code>make</code> overwrote my file and ran into the same issue again because it didn't use the proper flags. What you can do about this is to look for a file named <code>Makefile</code> and adjust its content so that the proper command will be generated.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> defined some variables and one of it is named <code>LIBS</code> with <code>LIBS = -lz -ldl</code>. So I added the missing flags with <code>LIBS = -lz -ldl -lm -lrt -lssl -lcrypto</code> and ran <code>make</code> again. Now the command printed the additonal ssl falgs and the compliation of the tool was succesful. Just one side node: the <code>Makefile</code> can occour in the source tree multiple times, so you need to be sure to adjust the correct one, where the related source file is located.</p>
<p>Conclusion: [ ] make sure that the compiler and linker can find the location of the shared libaries which you need for your compilation [ ] add the required flags for the libaries</p>
