### Self-Signed Certificate for uwp app code signing

In my case I needed the self-signed certificate for code signing a uwp app in my azure build pipeline. My uwp app is registered in the Microsoft store, and in this case Microsoft generates a package identity for the app and a unique publisher guid.

As the uwp package gets signed with a certificate, the certificate contains the publishers guid in the subject property. This way the app can be associated with the Microsoft store.

To create a self-signed certificate the PowerShell command `New-SelfSignedCertificate` can be used.

The full commands to create the certificate:

```powershell
$currentdate = Get-Date
$afteryears=$currentdate.AddYears(5)
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -Subject "CN=8F2F0FD9-...." -KeyUsage DigitalSignature
-FriendlyName "resize_codesign_cert" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3", "2.5.29.19={text}") -notafter $afteryears
```

- `$afteryears`, sets the year when the certificate expires
- `Type`, sets the CertificateType (Custom)
- `Subject`, should contain the publisher used by the microsoft store `CN={publisherguid}`
- `KeyUsage`, specifies the key usages set in the key usage extension of the certificate
- `FriendlyName`, a name to easily identify the usage of the certificate
- `CertStoreLocation`, the location, where the certificate should be stored, in this case the windows users certificate store
- `TextExtension`, in short tell the certificate that we use it as code signing certificate
- `$notafter`, sets the expiration date. If not set, the issued certificate will expire after one year

After the certificate is created it shows something like:

```powershell
   PSParentPath: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::CurrentUser\My

Thumbprint                                Subject
----------                                -------
C893A4D2EE53D3...                         CN=8F2F0FD9-2706-45A2-AB07-...
```

Tip: You can view the created certificate from the certificate store with `windowskey+R` enter `mmc`, `File` -> `Add/Remove Snap-in...` choose `Certificates`. A dialog prompt where you need to select `My user account`. Navigate in the left tree view to `Certificates - Current User\Personal\Certificates`. Double click one of the stored certificates to view its properties like Thumbprint, Subject, Expire date and so on.

Now we want to export the created certificate by PowerShell. Notice: A certificate with the extension `.pfx` contains the private and the public key!

To export the file we need to do the following:

```powershell
$password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String <Your Password> -Force -AsPlainText 
Export-PfxCertificate -cert "Cert:\CurrentUser\My\<Certificate Thumbprint in this case C893A4D2EE53D3...>" -FilePath <FilePath>.pfx -Password $password
```

Thatâ€™s it, the next step would be to integrate the certificate into the build pipeline.
