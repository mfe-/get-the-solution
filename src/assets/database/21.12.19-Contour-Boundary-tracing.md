### Find object contour with Boundary tracing

Recently my task was to find the contour of an object in an image. For this kind of problem the algorithm Boundary tracing, described in the book "Digital Image Processing"[1], can be applied. You input an binary image, and will retriev all points of the contour. The implementation expected that the object in the image is represented by white pixels (255 = white) and the background by black pixels (0 = black). An addition constraint is that the object isn't allowed to touch the border of the image, otherwise the implementation will fail.

This is because, in the first step we try to find the upper most left point of the object. We start at pixel 1,1 and walk into the left direction visiting every pixel and check the pixels value. If the pixels value is 0 (background) we visit the next pixel until we find the pixel which contains the value white which represents the object white. We store the position of the detected objects pixel into b0 (10,4). Also the previsited pixels position will be stored into c0 (9,4). I added an additional check to detect "single" pixel which are probably coming from noise.

The next step is to examine the nearby neighbor connected pixel, starting from c0 in a clockwise direction. This steps are repeated until we reach the inital upper most left point of the object (at 10,4).
