### Introduction

Imagine you have a linux or a windows service which is using different kinds of azure resources like Blob Storage, App Configuration, Azure Web Apps and so on. To access those resources one can use the secrets provided by the resources. To use these credentials you have to manage them all in your app and in azure itself. If the credentials change, worst case, you would need to adjust and redeploy the app.

A more password less approach could eliminate the need of managing any credentials. Maybe think of an app with a `SqlConnnection` which is using as authentication a sql user with password to connect to the database. As the app is run by a user (or service account), you can use this account to authenticate against the database instead of using the sql user.

With Azure App Registration and Azure Managed Identity its possible to "run" your app with an Azure Active Directory user or service principal. This user or service principal will have than the privileges to access for example Blob Storage, App Configuration and so on. The app only needs the credentials to identify it as the "registered app".

The App Registrations distinguish between `PublicClientApplication` and `ConfidentialClientApplication`.
The `PublicClientApplication` is expected to be a client app which is not capable of protecting any credentials (for example a mobile app). We will focus on `ConfidentialClientApplication` which runs on a server and is probably a web app, web API, or even service/daemon application.

### Workflow and Acquiring Tokens

To access any Azure Resources like the Azure App Configuration we send the credentials of our registered app to the azure authentication resource endpoint (for example App Configuration, GraphApi, Blob Storage, ....) to acquire an AccessToken for the requested Azure resource. Whenever we interact with the azure resource we need to send the acquired token with the header of the request. Because the access token can expire we need to renew it after it expired (We will not consider this scenario at the moment).

### Create a daemon app / ConfidentialClientApplication

1. In Azure go to Home and select your Azure Active Directory. Select `App registration`: Home > Default Directory | **App registrations**
2. Select `New registration`
3. Enter a name (for example `azureappreg`) and select `Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default Directory only - Single tenant)`
4. You should now see a new page: Home > Default Directory | **azureappreg**
5. In the left menu select: `Expose an Api` and under the title "Scopes defined by this API" press `Add a scope`
6. Enter an Application Scope. Instead of the guid you can enter for example `api://azureappregScope`
7. Next enter Scope name (for example `azureappreg.Read`), a consent display name for example `Read` and a consent description. Finish with `Add Scope`.
8. In the left menu select `Certificates & secrets`. Select `Client secrets`. Select `New Secret` and set a description and expiration date. Store the value of the Secret as you will later not be able to access it again.

9. The Microsoft Graph Api is a good way to test our setup. So lets go to the left menu and select `API Permissions`. You will see that Microsoft Graph with `User.Read` with `Delegated` was automatically added when we created the App registration. Because `Delegated` (your application needs to access the API as the signed-in user) permissions aren't supported for daemon apps, we need to add a new permission.
10. Select `Add Permission`. Select `Microsoft Graph` and `Application permissions`. Under Permissions select (Application) `Application.Read.All` and (User) `User.Read.All`. Press `Add Permission`.
11. Press the button `Grant admin consent` and confirm with `Yes`.
12. Its time to test our setup. Go to the left menu and select `Overview`. Obtain the Guid values from `Application (client) ID`, `Directory (tenant) ID` and `Application ID URI`.

To test if the registered app can query the graph api create a console project with:

```csharp
using Azure.Core; //nuget Azure.Core
using System.Net.Http.Headers;
using System.Text.Json;

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");

var clientid = "replace with Guid of Application (client) ID";
var clientSecret = "replace with secret from step 8";
var tenantid = "replace with Guid of Directory (tenant) ID";

var accessToken =await GetAccessTokenByScopeAsync(tenantid, "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default", clientid, clientSecret);
await GetApplicationsByGraphApiAsync(accessToken);

async Task<AccessToken> GetAccessTokenByScopeAsync(string tenantid, string scope, string clientId, string registeredAppSecrect)
{
    //https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#4-get-an-access-token
    var formUrlEncodedContent = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[]
        {
                new KeyValuePair<string, string>("client_id", clientId),
                new KeyValuePair<string, string>("client_secret", registeredAppSecrect),
                new KeyValuePair<string, string>("scope", scope),
                new KeyValuePair<string, string>("grant_type", "client_credentials")
            });
    HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
    var responseMessage = await httpClient.PostAsync($"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantid}/oauth2/v2.0/token", formUrlEncodedContent);
    var tokenResponse = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TokenResponse>(await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync());
    if (tokenResponse == null) throw new InvalidOperationException($"{nameof(TokenResponse)} expected!");
    return new AccessToken(tokenResponse.access_token, DateTimeOffset.Now + TimeSpan.FromSeconds(tokenResponse.expires_in));
}
async Task GetApplicationsByGraphApiAsync(AccessToken accessToken)
{
    if (DateTimeOffset.Now > accessToken.ExpiresOn)
    {
        //call again GetAccessTokenByScopeAsync
    }
    HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
    var defaultRequetHeaders = httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders;
    if (defaultRequetHeaders.Accept == null || !defaultRequetHeaders.Accept.Any(m => m.MediaType == "application/json"))
    {
        httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
    }
    defaultRequetHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken.Token);
    var responseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/");
    var outputString = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    using var jDoc = JsonDocument.Parse(outputString);
    outputString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(jDoc, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });
    Console.WriteLine(outputString);

    responseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/");
    outputString = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(outputString);
    //Calling the /me endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission.
    //Application permissions are not supported when using the /me endpoint.
    //responseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/");
    //outputString = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    //Console.WriteLine(outputString);
}
/// <summary>
/// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-v2-service#token-response
/// </summary>
public class TokenResponse
{
    public string token_type { get; set; }
    public int expires_in { get; set; }
    public int ext_expires_in { get; set; }
    public string access_token { get; set; }
}
```

The call `await GetAccessTokenByScopeAsync(tenantid, "https://graph.microsoft.com/.default", clientid, clientSecret);` requested a token as the registered app (in this example `azureappreg`) from the graph api. We use the returned token in `GetApplicationsByGraphApiAsync` to access the graph api for querying the applications and users. The query against `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/` should output the registered applications which were created. It's maybe worth mentioning that the registered app gets an access token for a request azure service even though it doesn't have any privileges to interact with the resource.
Maybe you also noticed the expiration of the `AccessToken`. If it expired you need to request a new Token.

### Read Configuration from App Configuration

To give the app access to the App Configuration do the following:

1. Create or switch to your App Configuration in azure for example `get-app-configuration | Identity`. Make sure Managed Identity is switched on (System assigned | Status on).
2. In the left menu of the App Configuration open Access Control (IAM). Select `Add role assignment` under "Grant access to this resource".
3. Choose for Role `App Configuration Data Reader`. On the next tab `Members` select `User, group, or service principal` and press "+Select Members" and search for the name of registered app (in this sample the name was `azureappreg` you will find the name also in the overview section of the registered app). To complete the operation press the button `Review + assign`.
4. Go to the overview of the App Configuration and copy the endpoint.

In the previous console project add the following method.

```csharp
async Task GetAppConfigurationAsync(AccessToken accessToken)
{
    if (DateTimeOffset.Now > accessToken.ExpiresOn)
    {
        //call again GetAccessTokenByScopeAsync
    }
    HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
    var defaultRequetHeaders = httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders;
    if (defaultRequetHeaders.Accept == null || !defaultRequetHeaders.Accept.Any(m => m.MediaType == "application/json"))
    {
        httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
    }
    defaultRequetHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", accessToken.Token);
    //see also the app configuration rest api for documentation
    var responseMessage = await httpClient
        .GetAsync("{replace with endpoint (see overview of app configuration)}/kv/?key=%2A&api-version=1.0");
    var outputString = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    using var jDoc = JsonDocument.Parse(outputString);
    outputString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(jDoc, new JsonSerializerOptions { WriteIndented = true });
    Console.WriteLine(outputString);
}
```

As we did before we need to acquire an access token for the app configuration using the app registered `clientid` and `clientsecret`. As `scope` we set our app configuration. After retrieving the access token we use it to query the app configuration rest api to access the configuration.

```csharp
var accessTokenAppConfiguration = await GetAccessTokenByScopeAsync(tenantid, "{replace with endpoint (see overview of app configuration)}/.default", clientid, clientSecret);
await GetAppConfigurationAsync(accessTokenAppConfiguration);
```

If you don't want to query the REST api of the App Configuration and use the more connivent `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration` nuget, the solution would look like the following:

```csharp
        var configurationBuilder = new ConfigurationBuilder();
        string AppConfigurationConnection = "https://yourentpoint.azconfig.io";
        configurationBuilder.AddAzureAppConfiguration(options =>
            {
                var credential =
                    new ClientSecretCredential(tenantid, clientid, clientSecret);
                options.Connect(new Uri(AppConfigurationConnection), credential);
                options.Select(KeyFilter.Any);
            });
        var configuration = configurationBuilder.Build();
```

If you fire up Fiddler you will notice that the `AzureAppConfiguration` will send exactly the same REST api calls as we did before. The first REST call will acquire the access token and the second call will query the app configuration using that token.

### Summary

In the above sample we used only the credentials of the registered app to access the Graph Api and App Configuration. When the registered app was set up a service principal was created in the Azure AD which represents our app. We then authorized this user to access our App Configuration.
