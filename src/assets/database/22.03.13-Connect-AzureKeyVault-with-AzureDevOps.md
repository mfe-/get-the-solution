### Connect Azure Key vault with AzureDevOps

I'm working on moving my credentials to the Azure Key vault. I already completed a crucial step which was done by creating a service connection in AzureDevops to Azure, [see here](blog/Connecting%20to%20Azure%20Devops%20with%20a%20Service%20Principal).

For my legacy build pipelines I stored my certificates and secrets under `Library` / `Variable groups` and `Secure files`.

Switching to the Azure Key vault is fairly easy. You only need to create a new `Variable group` under `Library`. I named the variable group `resize-image`.Then select `Link secrets from an Azure key vault as variables` and choose the previously created service principal (`AzureDevOpsKeyVaultServiceConnection` [see here](blog/Connecting%20to%20Azure%20Devops%20with%20a%20Service%20Principal)). Enter or select the name of the azure Key vault. Select `+Add` under `Variables`. A dialog is being displayed with all the key vault secrets and certificates. You can choose which secrets and certificates should be available under the created `Variable group`. Complete the setup by pressing the save button.

The next step is to "integrate" the created variable group in the `*.yml` pipeline by adding the group `group: resize-image` to `variables`.

```yml
[...]
variables:
- group: resize-image
[...]
```

Now you can access the secret `resizeappcenterid` with `$(resizeappcenterid)`. When you try to display the secrets using `echo` or a similar command you will only see `***` in order to not be exposed (it's a security feature).

Since I needed to sign my code with a certificate I had to adjust the task which downloaded the certificate from the legacy task `secure files`.
I didn't know how to use the certificate directly from the variable group, so I decided to write a powershell script which will download the certificate from the azure Key vault and convert it to a *.pfx file.
In the pipeline you need to use the task `AzurePowerShell` (Using `AzureCLI` will not work as the command `Get-AzKeyVaultSecret` will result in unknown cmdlet).

The task itself looks like the following:

```yml
- task: AzurePowerShell@5
  displayName: 'Download certificate & install'
  inputs:
    azurePowerShellVersion: 'LatestVersion'
    azureSubscription: 'KeyVaultServiceConnection'
    ScriptType: 'InlineScript'
    Inline: |     
      #the name of the key vault
      $keyvaultname='getkeyvault' 
      #the certificate name
      $certname="$(resizesigningCert)" 
      #the path to the certificate (required in the next steps)
      $certFilePath="$(Build.SourcesDirectory)\certName.pfx"
      #create a pipeline variable so it can be used in the next tasks
      Write-Host $certFilePath
      Write-Host "##vso[task.setvariable variable=certFilePath]$certFilePath"


      Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Security
      #get certificate from azure
      #$secret=az keyvault secret show -n $certname --vault-name $keyvaultname
      $secret = Get-AzKeyVaultSecret -VaultName $keyvaultname -Name $certname
      #convert secret to byte array
      $pass = $secret.SecretValue | ConvertFrom-SecureString
      $bstr = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($secret.SecretValue);
      $PlainTextString = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($bstr);
      $secretByte = [Convert]::FromBase64String($PlainTextString)
      $x509Cert = new-object System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2
      #import certificate
      $x509Cert.Import($secretByte, "", "Exportable,PersistKeySet")
      echo "imported"
      #store the pfx file
      $exportedpfx=$x509Cert.Export('PFX',"$(resizesigningCertpassword)")
      Set-Content -Path $certFilePath -Value $exportedpfx -Encoding Byte
```

The `*.pfx` file is now ready to use for code signing. In uwp this can look like the following

```yml
[...]
        /p:PackageCertificateThumbprint="$(resizesigningCertthumbprint)"
        /p:PackageCertificateKeyFile="$(certFilePath)"
        /p:PackageCertificatePassword="$(resizesigningCertpassword)"'
```

When running into problems in the build pipeline always examine the log and error message and try to reproduce it on your local device using the powershell command line.
