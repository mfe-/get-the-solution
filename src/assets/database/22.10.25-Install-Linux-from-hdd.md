### Intorduction

I tried to install linux on my surface pro 4, by following some installation guidelines specifically for installing linux on a surface pro. They recommended in general, to create a bootable linux usb, select “None” or “Microsoft & 3d-party CA” in the UEFI Settings and change the boot order properly.
However, my surface never booted from usb and always started windows. I still don’t know the reason for that behavior since I tried many different setups like different usb sticks, different applications to create a bootable linux usb and even in grub the usb stick never showed up.

### Installing grub2win

Since the UEFI Settings didn’t want to load my usb linux setup, I thought I Install grub2win and load from there my linux setup. For this I installed grub2win <https://sourceforge.net/projects/grub2win/> on my windows machine and disabled in the UEFI settings under security “Microsoft only”.
When booting into grub2win you can press “c” and a bash-like terminal will be displayed.
With ls you can view all existing partitions which were recognized by grub. However, grub also didn’t recognize my usb stick.
Create linux setup partition
I though, instead of using the usb media as installation source, I use my internal hard disc drive. For this I booted into windows and started `diskmgmt.msc`. I created on my main harddisc drive a new formatted FAT32 partition, than I copied the content of the usb media to the new partition (in my case I extracted the linux `.iso` file) and rebooted to grub2win.

### Start the linux setup from grub

With the command `ls` I tried to figure out, which `(hd0,gptx)` is behind my new created partition. It helps a lot if you know which folders and files are part of the linux setup media.
So I executed `Is (hd0 ,gpt7)`, `Is (hd0 ,gpt6)` and so on until I found folders and files which I would expect to be part of the linux setup media.

After I found the proper label of my partition, I executed the command
`set root=(hd0,gpt4)` followed by `chainloader /efi/boot/grubx64.efi` and `boot`.
Now it loaded my linux setup and finally I could install linux on my surface.
The full grub command history can be found here

```bash
GNU GRUB version 2.06
Minimal BASH- like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possible command completions. Anywhere else TAB lists possible device or file completions. ESC at any time exits.

After the linux setup is complete one can delete the temporary created linux setup partition.
