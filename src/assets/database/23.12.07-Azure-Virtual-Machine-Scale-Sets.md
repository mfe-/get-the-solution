## Why Azure Scale Sets?

To set the stage, let's first delve into the context and requirements of our scenario. Our clientele primarily utilizes our application during a specific recurring time frame in the afternoon to streamline their business operations. The application was hosted on-premises on a limited number of static machines.

While it's possible to horizontally scale the application by incorporating additional machines, this approach has its limitations. It requires significant manual intervention and lacks the flexibility to adapt to fluctuating demand. This is where Azure Scale Sets come into play.
