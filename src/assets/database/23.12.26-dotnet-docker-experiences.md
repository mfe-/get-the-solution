## Transitioning an Application from On-Premises to Azure Docker Containers

In a previous blog post, I discussed the process of migrating an on-premises application to an Azure Scale Set. Recently, I had the opportunity to transition an existing .NET background service to Azure. A key distinction between the previously migrated application and the one targeted for this migration was its lack of Windows dependencies. This meant that the application could be feasibly migrated to a Docker container.

### Starting with docker containers

Despite my limited experience with Docker containers, I was eager to delve deeper and expand my knowledge. I immersed myself in numerous documentation resources to understand how to create a Docker container using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Most [examples](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/docker/build-container?tabs=linux&pivots=dotnet-8-0#create-the-dockerfile) demonstrated the use of a Linux base image and the building of the application using the .NET CLI like the following:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build-env
WORKDIR /App

# Copy everything
COPY . ./
# Restore as distinct layers
RUN dotnet restore
# Build and publish a release
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Build runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0
WORKDIR /App
COPY --from=build-env /App/out .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "DotNet.Docker.dll"]
```

### The private nuget feed problem

The above Dockerfile works great for applications that do not have dependencies on private nuget feeds. However, as you might have anticipated, the application targeted for migration did rely on a private NuGet feed. One potential workaround for this predicament would be to incorporate the credentials for the private NuGet feed directly into the Dockerfile. There are diffrent ways to accomplish this, one of them can be read here [Consuming private NuGet feeds from a Dockerfile in a secure and DevOps friendly manner](https://blog.devops.dev/consuming-private-nuget-feeds-from-a-dockerfile-in-a-secure-and-devops-friendly-manner-b5c90ea90bba).

While this approach might seem straightforward, it's not without its drawbacks. Apart from the glaring security implications, the process of making these adjustments can be quite cumbersome.

Fortunately, the .NET CLI comes to the rescue, offering support for building Docker images with the command `dotnet publish --os linux --arch x64 /t:PublishContainer -c Release`. The Docker image was constructed within a CI/CD pipeline, an environment already authenticated and granted access to the private NuGet feed. As a result there was no need for additional configuration.

```yml

```
